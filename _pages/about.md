I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Carnegie Mellon Portugal affiliated Ph.D. ([CMU Portugal](https://www.cmuportugal.org/)) program in the Doctoral Program in Electrical and Computer Engineering ([PDEEC](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/en/cur_geral.cur_view?pv_curso_id=682)), at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering of the Faculty of Engineering of the University of Porto (FEUP), Portugal, and a researcher at [INESC-TEC](http://www.inesctec.pt/): Institute for Systems and Computer Engineering, in the Center for Biomedical Engineering Research (C-BER) in the Biomedical Research And INnovation (BRAIN) research group. 

My PhD thesis "Explainable Deep Learning Based Epileptic Seizure Classification with Clinical 3D Motion Capture" is supervised by [Prof. João Paulo Cunha](https://www.inesctec.pt/en/people/joao-paulo-cunha) and co-supervised by [Prof. Fernando De la Torre](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ftorre/). I am a visiting research scholar at the Computational Behavior ([CUBE](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/robotics-groups/computational-behavior-cube-lab/)) Lab working with [Prof. László A. Jeni](https://www.laszlojeni.com/), and at the Human Sensing Laboratory ([HSL](http://www.humansensing.cs.cmu.edu/home)) working with [Prof. Fernando De la Torre](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ftorre/) at The Robotics Institute (RI), Carnegie Mellon University (CMU). 

My research focuses on Advanced Human Sensing, 3D Motion Capture, Action and Pattern Recognition, Computer Vision, and Neuroengineering.

<!-- I have earned an MSc degree with honours in Biomedical Engineering (2018) from the Technical University of Denmark (DTU), where I worked on my master thesis entitled "Hybrid Motor Imaginary Brain Computer Interface and Virtual Reality based system for neurorehabilitation of stroke patients, employing deep learning classification"  supervised by [Sadasivan Puthusserypady](https://www.dtu.dk/english/Person/cwis?id=58827&tab=1&entity=profile) and co-supervised by [John Paulin Hansen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-D8JZiMAAAAJ&hl=da), and [Helle K. Iversen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=m6OT83wAAAAJ&hl=en).
I also earned a BSc (2016), and an MSc with highest honours (2020) in Mechatronics Engineering from Budapest University of Technology and Economics (BUTE). -->
